Description: The package uses a computationally efficient method to find the
    "Corrected Coverage Estimate" of a credible set of putative
    causal variants from Bayesian fine-mapping. The package can 
    also be used to obtain a "Corrected Credible Set" if required; 
    that is, the smallest set of variants required such that the
    corrected coverage estimate of the resultant credible set is  
    within some user defined accuracy of the desired coverage. 
    We recommend that our method is only used if the true effect
    in the genomic region is $> 2$, corresponding to $\hat\mu>2.5$.
