\dontrun{
 # this is a long running example

# In this example, the function is used to find a corrected 95\% credible set
# using bhats and their standard errors, that is the smallest set of variants
# required such that the resultant credible set has coverage close to (/within
# some accuracy of) the "desired coverage" (here set to 0.95). Max.iter parameter
# defines the maximum number of iterations to try in the root bisection algorithm,
# this should be increased to ensure convergence to the desired coverage, but is set
# to 1 here for speed (and thus the resultant credible set will not be accurate).
